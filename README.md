# Everything EveryPlate

This repository is designed to be a central location for information about
EveryPlate and HelloFresh ingredients, spices, and more. Being a public Github
project allows us to easily keep track of changes over time, and to add and
remove information quite easily.

If you are interested in helping keep this project up to date, feel free to
[file issues](/eslindsey/everyplate/issues) or
[submit pull requests](/eslindsey/everyplate/pulls).
