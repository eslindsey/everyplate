## Parts

If the recipe you're looking for only lists "parts," they are specifying the ingredients in terms of each
other. For example, if the recipe is 3 parts salt, 1 part black pepper, you could make that using 3 tsp of
salt and 1 tsp of pepper, or 6 TBSP of salt and 2 TBSP of pepper, or whatever unit is convenient for the
amount you are trying to make.
