This document is a record of how much EveryPlate and HelloFresh consider "1 unit" on
their recipe cards.

**Note:** Only ingredients listed like "1 | 2" or "1 unit | 2 units" will be included in
this list, and then only if the actual amount is dubious (so things like "Chicken Breast:
10 oz" and "Tomato: 1" will be excluded).
